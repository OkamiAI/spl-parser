SPL Parser
==========

Welcome to SPL Parser's documentation!

SPL Parser is a command-line application for parsing of Splunk's Search
Processing Language (SPL). The main feature of SPL Parser is the ability to
generate a tmLanguage grammar for SPL, which can be used in various text
editors for syntax highlighting of SPL. SPL Parser is also able to
interactively view details about any SPL command.

SPL Parser can be used with a remote Splunk server or with a local file.
